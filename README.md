## EMBR-AES: Expert-Mode and Deep Learning Integrated Automatic Essay Scoring System

### Project Introduction

In recent years, various fields and levels of academic competitions have emerged, leading to increased student participation. With the growing number of participating teams, the workload for reviewing papers has risen sharply, creating greater demands on human resources. Therefore, Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) systems have become a necessity, capable of reducing workload and improving the fairness of evaluations.

This paper proposes a new essay scoring frameworkâ€”**EMBR-AES**, aimed at enhancing the performance of automatic scoring systems by integrating expert models with deep learning methods. The **EMBR-AES** framework captures **shallow features** through universally defined expert patterns and utilizes the **ALBERT** model to extract **deep semantic features**. Finally, it employs a **neural network model** to uncover latent patterns and structures related to essay scoring.

### Features
- **Integration of expert-defined rules with deep learning technology**: Combines traditional rule-based scoring with advanced neural networks.
- **Transparent and interpretable scoring process**: Ensures clear and justifiable results.
- **High scoring speed**: Capable of handling large-scale competition applications efficiently.
- **Good adaptability and accuracy**: Demonstrates strong performance across different datasets.

## **TDBSW Dataset**
The **TDBSW dataset** originates from the **"Teddy Cup" Data Mining Challenge**. 

The **"Teddy Cup" Data Mining Challenge** is a national-level academic competition aimed at **graduate and undergraduate students**. It is designed to encourage students to actively engage in data mining, enhancing their ability to analyze and solve real-world problems. 

This competition is organized by the **Teddy Cup Data Mining Challenge Committee**, and the competition topics are primarily sourced from **real-world problems provided by enterprises, government institutions, and research organizations**. Participants are required to possess **statistical and data mining knowledge** as well as proficiency in relevant software tools.
