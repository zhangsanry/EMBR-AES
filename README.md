# EMBR-AES: Expert-Mode and Deep Learning Integrated Automatic Essay Scoring System

## Project Introduction

In recent years, various fields and levels of academic competitions have emerged, leading to increased student participation. With the growing number of participating teams, the workload for reviewing papers has risen sharply, creating greater demands on human resources. Therefore, Automatic Essay Scoring (AES) systems have become a necessity, capable of reducing workload and improving the fairness of evaluations.

This paper proposes a new essay scoring frameworkâ€”EMBR-AES, aimed at enhancing the performance of automatic scoring systems by integrating expert modes with deep learning methods. The EMBR-AES framework captures shallow features through universally defined expert patterns and utilizes the Albert model to capture deep semantic features. Finally, it employs a neural network model to uncover the latent patterns and structures related to essay scoring.

## Features
- Integration of expert-defined rules with deep learning technology
- Transparent and interpretable scoring process
- High scoring speed, suitable for large-scale competition applications
- Good adaptability and accuracy
